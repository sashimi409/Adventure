# Adventure

This is an as of Unnanamed Text based adventure/puzzle game framework

This project is a pet project to push my skills and get more experience as a developer. This means I do not have any solid plans on when stuff will be done

## Currently working on: 
 - Decoupling the framework from the "story"
 - This also involves restructuring the code


## Next up:
- Splitting the program into an editor and a player
- Move away from the command line
