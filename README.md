# Adventure

This is an as of Unnanamed Text based adventure/puzzle game framework

This project is a pet project to push my skills and get more experience as a developer. This means I do not have any solid plans on when stuff will be done

Currently working on: Decoupling the framework from the "story"
	-This includes adding in a file storage system


Next up
	-Splitting the program into an editor and a player
	-Move away from the command line
